This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.</li>\n<li><strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal information (often referred to as “the right to be forgotten”).

You also have the right to object if we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.</li>\n<li><strong>Request the restriction of processing</strong> of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example, if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it, or if we no longer need your data for our legitimate interests but we need to hold some of it for the purpose of legal proceedings.</li>\n<li><strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal information to another party.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you would like to exercise any of the above rights, please:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>email, call or write to us (see our contact details below);</li>\n<li>let us have proof of your identity and address (a copy of your driving licence or passport and a recent utility or credit card bill).
