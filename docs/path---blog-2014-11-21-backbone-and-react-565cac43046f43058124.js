It provides simple and flexible abstractions that developers can use to organize and create large-scale applications.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Backbone.js application development runs in to complexities with issues such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Heavy handed DOM wiping and reflows</li>\n<li>Preventing memory leaks and dreaded &#8220;<a href="http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2011/09/15/zombies-run-managing-page-transitions-in-backbone-apps/">Zombie Views</a>&#8220;</li>\n<li>Composing and aggregating child views correctly</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>React</h3>\n<p>Enter <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>. React is a UI (view) layer for web applications that uses virtual DOM rendering and a modular architecture for creating reusable, web components. It offers some exciting new possibilities as a replacement for<br />\nBackbone.js views, while keeping the rest of the framework pieces that Backbone.js does very well.</p>\n<h3>Backbone.js with React!</h3>\n<p>In my talk, I walk through a simple application, &#8220;<a href="http://formidablelabs.github.io/notes-react-exoskeleton/app.html">Notes</a>&#8221; (<em>live demo</em>),<br />\nthat uses Backbone.js with React views. The full source is available from one of our <a href="https://github.com/FormidableLabs/notes-react-exoskeleton">GitHub repos</a>.</p>\n<p>The talk <a href="http://slides.formidablelabs.com/201411-react-backbone.html">slides</a> go in to more detail, but some of the interesting results we get with a React-based view layer include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A slimmer overall minified bundle. With React as the view layer, we can remove dependencies on jQuery and Underscore.js.</li>\n<li>Server-side rendering. This is a <strong>huge</strong> feature, and actually quite easy with React. Even better, if you have a single-page JavaScript application for your site, React can <em>bootstrap</em> the HTML of the page server-side and then startup the app without re-rendering <em>any</em> HTML!</li>\n<li>&#8230; and some other pretty cool stuff!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To dive into the talk, hop on over to the <a href="http://slides.formidablelabs.com/201411-react-backbone.html">presentation website</a>.</p>\n<p>Or, for the more traditional folks, the talk  <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/RyanRoemer/backbonejs-with-react-views-server-rendering-virtual-dom-and-more">SlideShare deck</a> is available (with downloadable PDF).</p>',fields:{slug:"/blog/2014/11/21/backbone-and-react/"},frontmatter:{id:3,authorId:5,categoryIds:[1],date:"2014-11-21",pageDescription:"Thoughts on Backbone.js with React js view by Formidable's Ryan Romer.
