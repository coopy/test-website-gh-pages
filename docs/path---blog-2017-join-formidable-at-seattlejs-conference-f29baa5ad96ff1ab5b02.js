As the ongoing organizers of Seattle’s JavaScript user group, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/seattlejs/">SeattleJS</a>, we decided we had the opportunity and the obligation to make sure the powerful JavaScript forces of the Northwest came together this year.</p>\n<p><a href="http://seattlejs.com/">SeattleJS Conference</a> will be held on August 10th and 11th, just two blocks away from Formidable HQ at the Fremont Foundry. The conference will be a convergence of the top talent in JavaScript from the Pacific Northwest and beyond, looking at the language’s breadth and depth. </p>\n<p>In tandem with the conference, Formidable is also offering a two day training in advanced React and React Native. The training, held on August 8th and 9th at Formidable, will be led by a team of React experts and educators. If you’re looking to level up your expertise in React and learn best practices for building production-ready web and mobile applications, you won’t want to miss it.</p>\n<p>Tickets for the conference and training are available for sale now via <a href="https://seattlejs2017.eventbrite.com/">Eventbrite</a>. Early bird tickets are going quickly so be sure to reserve your spot ASAP.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about the training or conference, give us a holler on <a href="https://twitter.com/FormidableLabs">Twitter</a>.</p>',fields:{slug:"/blog/2017/join-formidable-at-seattlejs-conference/"},frontmatter:{id:44,authorId:15,categoryIds:[1,3,4,7],date:"2017-04-26",pageDescription:"Formidable is excited to partner with SeattleJS as the presenting sponsor for the first annual SeattleJS Conference.",pageKeywords:"developer, react, react native, react training, react native training",pageTitle:"Join Formidable at SeattleJS Conference",path:"/2017/join-formidable-at-seattlejs-conference/",title:"Join Formidable at SeattleJS Conference"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/blog/2017/join-formidable-at-seattlejs-conference/",prev:{fields:{slug:"/blog/2017/formidable-at-react-amsterdam/"},frontmatter:{authorId:15,categoryIds:[1,4],date:"2017-04-18",id:43,title:"Fun with Fiber Custom Renderers at React Amsterdam"}}}}}});
